Bias Analysis in Chest X-ray Disease Detection Models

This repository consists of implementations for TorchXRayVision pre-trained models for subgroup analysis and feature exploration. Domain adversarial neural networks can be loaded to mitigate bias in the presence of label noise.

Training is configurable and hyperparameters can be passed in through the command line to modify conditions.
