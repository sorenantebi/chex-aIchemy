Title: Bias Analysis in Chest X-ray Disease Detection Models

This repository aims to explore the subgroup performance and features of TorchXRayVision foundation (pre-trained) models. Domain Adversarial Neural Networks (DANN) can be implemented as a potential bias mitigation technique in the presence of label noise.

Training is configurable and hyperparameters can be passed in through the command line to modify conditions.
